# Immo-Eliza Property Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict property prices in Belgium using machine learning techniques. Developed as part of a skill enhancement initiative, it leverages the BeCode dataset to train a Random Forest Regressor model, focusing on features like total area, surface area, postal code, latitude, longitude, and the number of bedrooms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip for package installation

### Installation

    git@github.com:Danil-Zhuravlov/immo-eliza-ml.git
    cd immo-eliza-ml

**Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
On Windows use

    venv\Scripts\activate

**Install the dependencies**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

- **Training the model**

Run the `train.py` script to train the model on the provided dataset. This script preprocesses the data, trains the Random Forest Regressor model, and saves it for future predictions.

    python3 train.py

- **Making predictions**

Use the `predict.py` script to make price predictions on new property data. The script loads the trained model and uses it to predict the price based on the input features.

    python3 predict.py
